------ Detailed placement of (Tmp_Cell_(vga(vga(test))))...
------ Reading input data
------ Creating temporary data structures
------ Placement plane size : [292:336]
------ Doing placement 
 Can't place cell :score_translation  in window at (0,6)
 Can't place cell :mem_addr_demux  in window at (0,6)
 Can't place cell :field_check  in window at (0,6)

 Apparently the magnification coefficient is too small. 
 Let's try to run the algorithm for bigger magn. coefficient.
