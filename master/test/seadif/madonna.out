------ Detailed placement of (Tmp_Cell_(rom(rom(test))))...
------ Reading input data

------ Placement plane size : [171:168]
------ Doing placement 
 Can't place cell :subresult1  in window at (57,0)
 Can't place cell :ptype2eastwest  in window at (57,0)
 Can't place cell :ptype2northsouth  in window at (57,0)

 Apparently the magnification coefficient is too small. 
 Let's try to run the algorithm for bigger magn. coefficient.
