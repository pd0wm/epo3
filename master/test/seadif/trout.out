----- Some interesting statistics ------
Total number of nets:                 30 (100% completion)
Total length of routed wires:         0 (No new wires created)
No. of transistors (total / used):    504/454 = 90.08 %
CPU-time consumption:                 0.00 sec.
Elapsed time during routing:          0.00 sec. (100.00 % of cpu)
