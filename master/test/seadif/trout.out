----- Some interesting statistics ------
Number of nets successfully routed:   322 out of 447 (72.04%)
Total length of routed wires:         0 (No new wires created)
No. of transistors (total / used):    5400/3527 = 65.31 %
CPU-time consumption:                 0.27 sec.
Elapsed time during routing:          0.36 sec. (100.00 % of cpu)
WARNING:                              INCOMPLETE ROUTING!
------ Verifying Connectivity ------
