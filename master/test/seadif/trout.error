This is the file 'seadif/trout.error' which was created by
the program 'trout' on Tue Dec  3 18:01:30 2013
Trout was verifying the netlist description of
your circuit circuit 'vga' with the current layout in seadali.
The following nets in the layout are not according to
the netlist description of circuit 'vga'. They are also
marked in the layout.
------------------------- list of errors -------------------------
##### suspected short-circuit no. 1:
  > net 'mem_addr_reset_field_2_port' (1 terms, e.g. terminal  'mem_addr_reset_out_7_0_2')
  > net 'mem_addr_reset_field_1_port' (2 terms, e.g. terminal 'mem_addr_reset_in_7_0_1')
  > net 'mem_addr_reset_field_0_port' (2 terms, e.g. terminal 'mem_addr_reset_in_7_0_0')
  > net 'X_Logic0_port' (10 terms, e.g. terminal 'vss')

WARNING: 1 short-circuit(s) were detected among the 51 nets.
         These nets were separatedly specified in the circuit
         but are connected in the layout.  This may occur because of
         feed-throughs in sub-cells and it doesn't necessarily
         imply an error.
         In the layout each short-circuit is indicated by a marker
         which indicates a position on the pattern: <=-SHORT_<no>
