Trout was verifying the netlist description of
your circuit circuit 'log_score' with the current layout in seadali.
The following nets in the layout are not according to
the netlist description of circuit 'log_score'. They are also
marked in the layout.
------------------------- list of errors -------------------------
##### suspected short-circuit no. 1:
  > net 'output_7_0_7' (1 terms, e.g. terminal  'log_out_7_0_7')
  > net 'score_to_log_7_port' (2 terms, e.g. terminal 'log_in_7_0_7')

WARNING: 1 short-circuit(s) were detected among the 21 nets.
         These nets were separatedly specified in the circuit
         but are connected in the layout.  This may occur because of
         feed-throughs in sub-cells and it doesn't necessarily
         imply an error.
         In the layout each short-circuit is indicated by a marker
         which indicates a position on the pattern: <=-SHORT_<no>
