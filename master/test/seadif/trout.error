Trout was verifying the netlist description of
your circuit circuit 'top_level' with the current layout in seadali.
The following nets in the layout are not according to
the netlist description of circuit 'top_level'. They are also
marked in the layout.
------------------------- list of errors -------------------------
##### suspected short-circuit no. 1:
  > net 'SYNTHESIZED_WIRE_1' (1 terms, e.g. terminal  'new_number')
  > net 'SYNTHESIZED_WIRE_0' (2 terms, e.g. terminal 'button_seed')
  > net 'SYNTHESIZED_WIRE_40_2_port' (2 terms, e.g. terminal 'y_3_0_2')
  > net 'rst' (12 terms, e.g. terminal 'rst')

WARNING: 1 short-circuit(s) were detected among the 126 nets.
         These nets were separatedly specified in the circuit
         but are connected in the layout.  This may occur because of
         feed-throughs in sub-cells and it doesn't necessarily
         imply an error.
         In the layout each short-circuit is indicated by a marker
         which indicates a position on the pattern: <=-SHORT_<no>
