This is the file 'seadif/trout.error' which was created by
the program 'trout' on Tue Dec 10 09:47:22 2013
Trout was verifying the netlist description of
your circuit circuit 'vga' with the current layout in seadali.
The following nets in the layout are not according to
the netlist description of circuit 'vga'. They are also
marked in the layout.

WARNING: 38 out of the 79 nets are not properly connected.
         In the layout each of the unconnects is marked by
         an arrow followed by the name of the net: <=-<net_name>
WARNING: 2 short-circuit(s) were detected among the 79 nets.
         These nets were separatedly specified in the circuit
         but are connected in the layout.  This may occur because of
         feed-throughs in sub-cells and it doesn't necessarily
         imply an error.
         In the layout each short-circuit is indicated by a marker
         which indicates a position on the pattern: <=-SHORT_<no>
