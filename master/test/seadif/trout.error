This is the file 'seadif/trout.error' which was created by
the program 'trout' on Thu Dec 12 10:53:18 2013
Trout was verifying the netlist description of
your circuit circuit 'controller' with the current layout in seadali.
The following nets in the layout are not according to
the netlist description of circuit 'controller'. They are also
marked in the layout.

WARNING: 125 out of the 447 nets are not properly connected.
         In the layout each of the unconnects is marked by
         an arrow followed by the name of the net: <=-<net_name>
