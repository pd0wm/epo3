  Dear user,

You just tried to put a layout object to the left of - or 
below the origin. I would like to remind you that the sea-of-
gates tools (fish, madonna, trout, etc) only accept positive
coordinates. In other words: you should only work in the
first quadrant. I put the object at the place which you
indicated, but I couldn't snap it to the image because there
is no image over there.

Have wonderful day with even better layouts,

                                    Seadali


P.S.
If you want me to stop complaining about this, just turn
off the 'image mode' in the settings menu
terminate
lock
