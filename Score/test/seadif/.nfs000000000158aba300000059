------ Detailed placement of (score(score(score(test2))))...
------ Reading input data

------ Placement plane size : [60:84]
------ Doing placement 
 Can't place cell :score_reg_5_inst  in window at (20,0)

 Apparently the magnification coefficient is too small. 
 Let's try to run the algorithm for bigger magn. coefficient.
